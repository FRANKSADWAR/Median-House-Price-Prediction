# Median House Price Prediction

I this notebook, I will walk through the steps in predicting the median house prices for a real-estate company in Califonia.
I will start with a simple machine learning model, which I will then adopt with a hypothesis that the locations have an influence in the median house prices. ( I am thinking of a spatial regression analysis here).
This is a regression model, hence the output of the supervised learning technique will output a single prediction value.
